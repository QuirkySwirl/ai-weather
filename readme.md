# 1-shot weather app prompt for AI
## Best output from V0 
## Second best output from Claude 3.5-sonnet
### GPT-o1 is hyped and expensive for what is does
#### I will be sharing the output from each of these experiments shortly

Here is the prompt I used

  Make an HTML, CSS and JS weather app!
  Use https://wttr.in as the endpoint to fetch weather information
  -Background: Use this gradient mesh:
  background: #000000; background-image: radial-gradient(at 13.6% 84.1%, #00ffea 0px, transparent 50%),radial-gradient(at 89.4% 84.8%, #ff6be4 0px, transparent 50%),radial-gradient(at -8.5% 19.2%, hsl(57, 100%, 50%) 0px, transparent 50%)
  -Design: It should have glassmorphism boxes and it should look modern and beautiful with icons and so onâ€¦
